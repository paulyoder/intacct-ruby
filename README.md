# IntacctRuby

A wrapper for [Intacct's API](https://developer.intacct.com/wiki/functions-object), which tries to stay as close as it can to the syntax and philosophy of the API itself.

## The Power of Multi-Function Api Calls

Unlike the other Gems out in the Rubyverse, this library supports one of the Intacct API's most powerful features: multi-function API calls.

### Why Does This Matter?

In an ERP system like Intacct, you'll probably want to perform multiple actions at once, like debiting one account and crediting another, or creating several associated records simulatenously. The more calls you make, the longer it will take to see a response. That's just a fact. But if you can bundle all of those actions together into a single call, you lower the load on both your system and Intacct's servers and guarantee yourself a quicker response. Intacct's entire API is built around this idea, and `IntacctRuby` translates that philosophy into Ruby.

### Putting Gem to Use

Let's say you want to create a project and a customer associated with that project simultaneously. The Intacct API would tell you to create a call with a `<create><CUSTOMER>` function followed by a `<create><PROJECT>` function. So let's do it!

```ruby
# REQUEST_OPTS contains authentication information. See 'Authentication' section
# for more information.
request = IntacctRuby::Request.new(REQUEST_OPTS)

request.create object_type: :CUSTOMER, parameters: {
  CUSTOMERID: '1',
  FIRST_NAME: 'Han',
  LAST_NAME: 'Solo',
  TYPE: 'Person',
  EMAIL1: 'han@solo.com',
  STATUS: 'active'
}

request.create object_type: :PROJECT, parameters: {
  PROJECTID: '1',
  NAME: 'Get Chewie a Haircut',
  PROJECTCATEGORY: 'Improve Wookie Hygene',
  CUSTOMERID: '1',
  SHAMPOO: 'true', # a custom field
  BLOWDRY: 'false' # a custom field
}

request.send
```

**Note:** Here `:CUSTOMER` and `:PROJECT` are object-types which are tagged just after the function tag `create` and are case-sensitive along with the extra-parameters(CUSTOMERID, FIRST_NAME ..)

This will fire off a request that looks something like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<request>
   <control><!-- Authentication Params --></control>
   <operation transaction="true">
      <authentication><!-- Authentication Params --></authentication>
      <content>
         <function controlid="create-customer-2017-08-03 17:02:40 UTC">
            <create>
               <CUSTOMER>
                  <CUSTOMERID>1</CUSTOMERID>
                  <FIRST_NAME>Han</FIRST_NAME>
                  <LAST_NAME>Solo</LAST_NAME>
                  <TYPE>Person</TYPE>
                  <EMAIL1>han@solo.com</EMAIL1>
                  <STATUS>active</STATUS>
               </CUSTOMER>
            </create>
         </function>
         <function controlid="create-project-2017-08-03 17:02:40 UTC">
            <create>
               <PROJECT>
                  <PROJECTID>1</PROJECTID>
                  <NAME>Get Chewie a Haircut</NAME>
                  <PROJECTCATEGORY>Improve Wookie Hygene</PROJECTCATEGORY>
                  <CUSTOMERID>1</CUSTOMERID>
                  <SHAMPOO>true</SHAMPOO>
                  <BLOWDRY>false</BLOWDRY>
               </PROJECT>
            </create>
         </function>
      </content>
   </operation>
</request>
```

### Legacy Endpoints

The Intacct team has deprecated a number of endpoints which are now only accessible via the legacy API. This API has a different expectation on XML body syntax as well as parameter order enforcement via XSD. The process to construct a legacy request is similar to a standard request, just using the `LegacyRequest` class.

```ruby
request = IntacctRuby::LegacyRequest.new(REQUEST_OPTS)

request.create object_type: :record_cctransaction, parameters: {
  chargecardid: '1',
  paymentdate: { year: 2019, month: 11, day: 11 },
  ccpayitems: [
    cpayitem: {
      glaccountno: 1234,
      paymentamount: '0.99',
      locationid: 1,
    }
  ]
}

request.create object_type: :reverse_cctransaction, parameters: {
  key: '4321',
  datereversed: { year: 2019, month: 11, day: 11 },
  memo: 'Purchase returned for refund'
}

request.send
```

The legacy request class will generate XML that looks something like this.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<request>
   <control><!-- Authentication Params --></control>
   <operation transaction="true">
      <authentication><!-- Authentication Params --></authentication>
      <content>
         <function controlid="create-record_cctransaction-2019-06-30 16:45:12 UTC">
            <record_cctransaction>
               <chargecardid>1</chargecardid>
               <paymentdate>
                  <year>2019</year>
                  <month>11</month>
                  <day>11</day>
               </paymentdate>
               <ccpayitems>
                  <ccpayitem>
                     <glaccountno>1234</glaccountno>,
                     <paymentamount>'0.99'</paymentamount>
                     <locationid>1</locationid>
                  </ccpayitem>
               </ccpayitems>
            </record_cctransaction>
         </function>
         <function controlid="create-reverse_cctransaction-2019-06-30 16:45:12 UTC">
            <reverse_cctransaction>
               <key>4321</key>
               <datereversed>
                  <year>2019</year>
                  <month>11</month>
                  <day>11</day>
               </datereversed>
               <memo>Purchase returned for refund</memo>
            </reverse_cctransaction>
         </function>
      </content>
   </operation>
</request>
```

### Read Requests

The read requests follow a slightly different pattern. The object-type is mentioned inside the `object` tag as seen here [Intacct List Journal Entries](https://developer.intacct.com/api/general-ledger/journal-entries/#list-journal-entry-lines).  Hence, read requests don't accept a `object_type:` argument directly, the object type is passed through the parameters argument. The following code will read all GLENTRY objects in a specific interval

**Note:** The gem encodes the queries to a valid XML so that you don't have to. You can query using the `&, >, <` operators as seen below.

```ruby
request = IntacctRuby::Request.new(REQUEST_OPTS)

# Object-Type GLENTRY is sent through the parameters arguments
request.readByQuery parameters: {
  object: 'GLENTRY',
  query: "BATCH_DATE >= '03-01-2018' AND BATCH_DATE <= '03-15-2018'",
  fields: '*',
  pagesize: 100
}

request.send
```

This will fire off a request that looks something like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<request>
   <control><!-- Authentication Params --></control>
   <operation transaction="true">
      <authentication><!-- Authentication Params --></authentication>
      <content>
         <function controlid="readByQuery-2017-08-03 17:02:40 UTC">
            <readByQuery>
                <object>GLENTRY</object>
                <fields>*</fields>
                <query>BATCH_DATE &gt;= '03-01-2018' AND BATCH_DATE &lt;= '03-15-2018'</query>
                <pagesize>100</pagesize>
            </readByQuery>
         </function>
      </content>
   </operation>
</request>
```

Similarly, for pagination use the `readMore` function as mentioned here [Intacct Paginate Results](https://developer.intacct.com/web-services/queries/#paginate-results)

```ruby
request = IntacctRuby::Request.new(REQUEST_OPTS)

request.readMore parameters: {
  resultId: '7765623332WU1hh8CoA4QAAHxI9i8AAAAA5'
}

request.send
```

This will fire off a request that looks something like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<request>
   <control><!-- Authentication Params --></control>
   <operation transaction="true">
      <authentication><!-- Authentication Params --></authentication>
      <content>
         <function controlid="readMore-2017-08-03 17:02:40 UTC">
            <readMore>
              <resultId>7765623332WU1hh8CoA4QAAHxI9i8AAAAA5</resultId>
            </readMore>
         </function>
      </content>
   </operation>
</request>
```

In addition to these functions, you may also call the `query` function. Intacct released this as a newer version of the `readByQuery` function. The `query` function provides for more specific filtering as well as some additional options such as "offset" and "orderby". [Advantages of query](https://developer.intacct.com/web-services/queries/#advantages-of-query).

```ruby
request = IntacctRuby::Request.new(REQUEST_OPTS)

request.query parameters: {
   object: 'VENDOR',
   select: [
     { field: "RECORDNO" },
     { field: "NAME" },
   ],
   filter: {
      like: {
         field: "NAME",
         value: "A%"
      }
   },
   pagesize: 100,
   offset: 50,
   orderby: {
      order: {
         field: "RECORDNO",
         descending: "true"
      }
   }
}

request.send
```

This will fire off a request that looks something like this:

```xml
<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>
<request>
  <control><!-- Authentication Params --></control>
  <operation transaction=\"true\">
    <authentication><!-- Authentication Params --></authentication>
    <content>
      <function controlid=\"query--202	1-07-26 19:27:38 UTC\">
        <query>
          <object>VENDOR</object>
          <select>
            <field>RECORDNO</field>
          </select>
          <filter>
            <like>
              <field>NAME</field>
              <value>A%</value>
            </like>
          </filter>
          <pagesize>100</pagesize>
          <offset>50</offset>
          <orderby>
            <order>
              <field>RECORDNO</field>
              <descending>true</descending>
            </order>
          </orderby>
        </query>
      </function>
    </content>
  </operation>
</request>

```

If there are function errors (e.g. you omitted a required field) you'll see an error on response. Same if you see an internal server error, or any error outside of the 2xx range.

## Authentication

Before we go any further, make sure you've read the [Intacct API Quickstart Guide](https://developer.intacct.com/web-services/) and [their article on constructing XML Requests](https://developer.intacct.com/web-services/requests/)

In IntacctRuby - as with the Intacct API that the gem wraps - your system credentials are pass along with each separate `Request` instance. The functions that define a request are followed by a hash that spells out each piece of information required by Intacct for authentication. These fields are:

* `senderid`
* `sender_password`\*
* `userid`
* `companyid`
* `user_password`\*

\* _In [Intacct's documentation](https://developer.intacct.com/wiki/constructing-web-services-request), these are referred to only as `password`. This won't work in Rubyland, though, because we can't have multiple hash entries with the same key._

### Authentication Example:

```ruby
IntacctRuby::Request.new(
  some_function,
  another_function,
  senderid: 'some_senderid_value',
  sender_password: 'some_sender_password_value',
  userid: 'some_userid_value',
  companyid: 'some_companyid_value',
  user_password: 'some_user_password_value'
)
```

Though, it probably makes more sense to keep all of these in some handy constant for easy reuse:

```ruby
REQUEST_OPTS = {
  senderid: 'some_senderid_value',
  sender_password: 'some_sender_password_value',
  userid: 'some_userid_value',
  companyid: 'some_companyid_value',
  user_password: 'some_user_password_value'
}.freeze

IntacctRuby::Request.new(REQUEST_OPTS)
```

### Important Notes on Authentication

#### These Are Required!

Obviously, Intacct won't do anything if you don't tell it who you are. To save you the bandwidth, **this gem will throw errors if any of these auth params are not provided.**

#### BE SAFE!

Though the examples above show hard-coded username/password pairs, this is a really bad idea to do in production code. Instead, we recommend storing these variables in ENVs, using a tool like [Figaro](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro) to bring it all together.

## Customizing Calls

This gem creates calls using the following defaults:

* **uniqueid:** false,
* **dtdversion:** 3.0,
* **includewhitespace:** false,
* **transaction:** true

If you'd like to override any of these, you can do so when you create a new request by adding additional fields to the options hash passed into `Request#new`:

```ruby
REQUEST_OPTS = {
  senderid: 'some_senderid_value',
  sender_password: 'some_sender_password_value',
  userid: 'some_userid_value',
  companyid: 'some_companyid_value',
  user_password: 'some_user_password_value'
}

REQUEST_OPTS.merge!(
  uniqueid: 'some_uniqueid_override',
  dtdversion: 'some_dtd_override'
)

IntacctRuby::Request.new(REQUEST_OPTS)
```
